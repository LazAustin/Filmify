This Project is a Library Management System for Streaming Video Purchases. It is built on the MERN stack, and I am currently working on the front end. Bcrypt, JWT, and a REST API are used for authentication. The front end will also feature Redux and Redux Toolkit as well as Material UI components, include Date Picker and Pagination. It will also utilize node scheduler or some other service to send reminder emails periodically before their access expires.
